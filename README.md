# Dimension-reduction-analysis-and-clustering

This repository contains R code and data for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering on a dataset that explores the nutritional content of various pizza brands. The dataset includes information on moisture, protein, fat, ash, sodium, carbohydrates, and calories per 100 grams for each pizza sample.

Key Components:

Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of nutritional components in the dataset using histograms to gain insights into the data's characteristics.
Data Preparation: Normalize the data and calculate the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different nutritional variables.
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-means clustering to group the pizza samples into clusters based on their nutritional profiles. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS): Use MDS to create a 2D plot, which helps visualize the relationships between pizza samples in a reduced-dimensional space.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Conduct PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and explore the contribution of each variable to the principal components.
DBSCAN Clustering: Perform Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) on the MDS-transformed data to identify clusters based on density and noise.

This project allows to explore the nutritional content of different pizza brands, discover patterns in the data, and cluster similar pizza samples based on their nutritional profiles. It can be a valuable resource for data analysis and visualization enthusiasts, especially those interested in food science and nutrition.

Feel free to use and modify this code for your own analyses or expand upon it for further insights into nutritional data.
